        Quanta collects no personal data or data linked to individual users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app runs locally and the only data sent off of your device or iCloud account (for sync across devices) are anonymous metrics to improve further development. Nothing is associated with you or sent to third-parties.

      If you have any questions or concerns about Quanta's privacy practices, please do not hesitate to contact me.
